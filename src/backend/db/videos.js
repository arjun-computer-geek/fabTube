    title: "TRUST ISSUES with setTimeout() | Namaste JavaScript Ep.17",
    description: `This BONUS video covers the fundamentals of setTimeout, how it works behind the scenes. We also discover that setTimeout does not guarantee that the callback method will be executed exactly after a certain delay. Hence, there are trust issues with setTimeout. üòÖ

    Moreover, we will also cover the case of setTimeout with 0 delay. It's a very famous Interview question and confuses a lot of new developers. 
    
    Towards the end, I also show the demo of how you can set up exactly the same playground to write code, just like I do in these videos. Check that out and I highly recommend you to set up a similar playground and experiment a lot with code while watching Namaste JavaScript üôè
    
    The only request is to watch this Episode of Namaste JavaScript with full attention.
